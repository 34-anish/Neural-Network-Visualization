Neural networks are powerful computational models used in various fields, including machine learning and artificial intelligence. Understanding the structure and behavior of neural networks is crucial for researchers and practitioners in these domains. This project aims to provide an interactive visualization of a neural network, enhancing understanding its components and processes. Although numerous academics have extensively used computer simulations to study neural network learning systems, the graphical presentation of information in these simulations has gotten comparatively little attention. The creation of "scientific visualization" approaches has shown to be a very helpful tool for research, development, and instruction in the domains of artificial intelligence
